319 earthquakes with magnitudes between M3.0 and M6.9 occurring in Sichuan-yunnan Block from January 2009 to May 2018. 
We determined the mechanism solutions of 234 earthquakes by the CAP method, using the broadband waveforms 
recorded by Chinese regional permanent networks, and collected 85 centroid moment tensor solutions from the GCMT.
